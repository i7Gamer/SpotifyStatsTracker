    Also patches Spotify.track() to fetch metadata through spotapi.Public's locked
    client pool instead of spotapi.Song()'s process-wide shared default client.

    This is called automatically below at import time, but it's also exposed as a
    plain function (rather than only running once as module-level code) so callers
    can re-invoke it deliberately - e.g. a test module that needs the real
    SpotipyFree.Spotify patched can call this itself instead of depending on which
    other test module happened to import Database.patches first. Module-level code
    only ever runs once per process, so if it first ran while some other test's
    sys.modules["SpotipyFree"] mock was still in place, the real module would never
    get patched for the rest of the process without a way to retry.

    Returns True if the patch was applied, False if SpotipyFree is currently mocked
